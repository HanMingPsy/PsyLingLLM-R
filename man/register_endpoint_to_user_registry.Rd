\title{Upsert endpoint entry into the user registry (safe merge)}
\usage{
register_endpoint_to_user_registry(entry, path = get_registry_path())
}
\arguments{
\item{entry}{A named list, typically returned by `build_registry_entry_from_analysis()`.}

\item{path}{Optional registry YAML path (defaults to `get_registry_path()`).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the merged registry list.
}
\description{
This function inserts or updates an LLM endpoint entry in a YAML-based
user registry. If an entry with the same key (e.g. "deepseek-chat@chutes.ai")
already exists, new generation interface nodes (e.g. `chat`, `completion`)
are merged instead of overwriting the whole model section.
}
\details{
Interface nodes are automatically detected by structure â€” any list
containing fields like `input`, `output`, `streaming`, or `provider`
will be treated as an interface definition.

The registry file is rewritten with header comments and each model
section separated by comment lines for readability.
