\title{Replace \code{"\${VARS}"} placeholders inside nested lists or atomic values}
\usage{
replace_placeholders(x, mapping)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An R object (typically a list or character vector) that may contain
placeholders such as \code{"\${MODEL}"} or \code{"\${CONTENT}"}.}

\item{mapping}{A named list providing keyâ€“value pairs for substitution, e.g.,
\code{list(MODEL = "deepseek-chat", TEMPERATURE = 0.7)}.}
}
\value{
An object of the same structure as \code{x}, with placeholders replaced
  by corresponding values from \code{mapping}. Non-matching elements and
  non-character types are returned unchanged.
}
\description{
This internal utility performs recursive placeholder substitution within a
nested R structure (lists or atomic vectors). Each occurrence of a placeholder
of the form \code{"\${VARNAME}"} is replaced by its corresponding value from
the provided mapping list. The function preserves input types where possible
(e.g., numeric, logical, or character) and leaves non-character atoms unchanged.
