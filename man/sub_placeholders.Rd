\title{Substitute placeholders \code{"\${API_KEY}"}, \code{"\${CONTENT}"}, \code{"\${ROLE}"} robustly}
\usage{
sub_placeholders(x, mapping)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A list or atomic vector containing placeholder strings.}

\item{mapping}{A named list providing substitution values, e.g.,
\code{list(API_KEY = "...", CONTENT = "...", ROLE = "user")}.}
}
\value{
The transformed object, with all placeholders replaced by their
  corresponding mapped values.
}
\description{
This function performs recursive placeholder substitution within nested R
structures (lists or atomic vectors). Each placeholder string of the form
\code{"\${VARNAME}"} is replaced by its corresponding value from the provided
mapping list.
}
\details{
**Features**
\itemize{
  \item Works on nested lists and atomic vectors.
  \item Replacement values are coerced to length-1 character strings and
        escaped for Perl regular expressions.
  \item \code{NULL}, \code{NA}, or non-scalar replacements are converted to
        empty strings (\code{""}).
