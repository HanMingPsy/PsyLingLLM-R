\title{Get a nested value by a mixed path (character keys and integer indices)}
\usage{
list_get_by_path(x, path)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A list or list-like R object from which to retrieve a nested value.}

\item{path}{A vector or list of path segments. Each segment may be either:
\itemize{
  \item A **character key**, e.g. `"messages"`;
  \item An **integer index**, e.g. `2L`.
}
The function follows these segments in order to descend into nested structures.}
}
\value{
The nested value located at the specified path, or `NULL`
  if the path does not exist or cannot be traversed.
}
\description{
This helper function retrieves a nested value from a list-like object
by following a *mixed path* consisting of character keys (for named lists)
and/or integer indices (for unnamed elements).
}
\details{
It is tolerant to structural inconsistencies: if any intermediate
component is missing, `NULL`, or not a list, the function returns `NULL`
rather than throwing an error.
