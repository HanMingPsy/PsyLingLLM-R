\title{Recursively find the first path to a placeholder string}
\usage{
find_placeholder_path(x, placeholder = "${CONTENT}")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A nested R object (usually a list or list-like structure) to be searched.}

\item{placeholder}{Character(1). The exact scalar string value to look for.
Defaults to \code{"\${CONTENT}"}.}
}
\value{
A list of path segments (keys or indices) leading to the first
  occurrence of the placeholder, or `NULL` if not found.
}
\description{
This utility function traverses a nested R object (typically a list)
to locate the first scalar string that exactly matches a given placeholder
value (by default, \code{"\${CONTENT}"}). It performs a depth-first search
and returns the traversal path as a list of keys and/or indices.
}
\details{
Path segments are expressed as character keys or integer indices,
for example:
```
list("messages", 2, "content")
```
indicating that the placeholder was found at
`x[["messages"]][[2]][["content"]]`.
